# CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview

Windows-only Go project. CI builds + vets on every push/PR. Release workflow cuts a GitHub Release with the binary + changelog when tagged.

## Version File

`VERSION` at repository root — single plain-text file containing the semver string (e.g. `0.1.10`). This is the canonical source:

- `go build -ldflags="-X main.Version=$(cat VERSION)"` injects it into the binary
- CI reads it for artifact naming
- Release workflow validates the git tag matches `VERSION` before building
- `meta/CHANGELOG.md` headings must match

## Workflows

### CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Push to `main`, `v0.3.x` | Build + vet + upload artifact |
| PR to `main`, `v0.3.x` | Build + vet |

### Vtable verification

Vtable smoke tests are planned for CI integration. See [`docs/reference/vtable-verification.md`](reference/vtable-verification.md) for the proposed test suite and integration steps.

Artifact name: `mcp-server-windows-<sha>` (uses `${{ github.sha }}` in CI workflow)

### Release (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Push tag `v*` | Build + SHA256 + GitHub Release |

Validates tag matches VERSION file. Builds with Zig cc + CGO. Extracts the corresponding section from `meta/CHANGELOG.md` as release body. Uploads `mcp-server.exe` + `mcp-server.exe.sha256`.

## Branching Strategy

```
main  ───────────────────────────────────●─── (stable releases)
                                         │
v0.3.x ─────●──●──●──●──●──●──●─────────┘
             (feature work, recording/ML/enrichment)
```

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Stable — release-ready. CI runs. Tags cut here. |
| `v0.2.0-alpha` | Feature branch for v0.2.0 work (chain tool, SQLite memory store, layout validation, template library, ONNX ML). CI runs. PRs merge into `main`. |
| Feature branches | Short-lived forks from `v0.2.0-alpha`. Squash-merged. |

### Release Cycle

See [`reference/versioning-strategy.md`](reference/versioning-strategy.md) for the full release process including version bump, changelog update, pre-release gates, tagging, and pushing. The CI workflow triggers on tag push and handles the automated build + publish.

## Running CI Locally

```powershell
# Full lint (vet + build)
.\scripts\lint.ps1

# Just vet
go vet ./...

# Build with version injection
$ver = (Get-Content VERSION -Raw).Trim()
go build -ldflags="-X main.Version=$ver" -o mcp-server.exe ./cmd/mcp-server/

# Benchmark
go run ./cmd/benchmark/
```
