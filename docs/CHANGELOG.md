# Changelog

## [0.2.18] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Post-Task Introspection Engine** (`internal/actions/introspection.go`) — three new MCP tools for task-aware self-improvement:
  - `task_begin` — marks task start with description, timestamps
  - `task_end` — closes task, mines insights from command_log between start/end: slowest tools, most failed tools, OCR stats, repeated command patterns, and improvement suggestions
  - `introspection_analyze` — browse completed task history with full insight data
  - Uses existing `command_log` + `ocr_log` tables — no new logging infra needed
  - `task_log` table added to datalog DB

### Changed

- `datalog_status` now reports `task_count` in stats

## [0.2.17] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- **OCR→Training bridge window** — `bridgeWindow` increased from 3s to 30s. The OCR→AI→MCP→Click round trip regularly exceeded the original 3-second window, preventing training pair creation. Debugged via new `bridgeBufferSize()` and `BridgeDebugInfo()` diagnostic functions exposed through the `bridge_debug` MCP tool.

### Added

- **`bridge_debug` MCP tool** — debug the OCR→command bridge state, showing recent OCR buffer contents, pending command, and timing info.

## [0.2.16] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Adaptive Engine** (`internal/actions/adaptive.go`) — pure Go statistical ML system with three components:
  - **TimingTracker** — rolling-window (N=100) per-tool statistics: mean, stddev, min, max. Auto-suggests adaptive delays based on historical execution time plus success-rate multiplier (1.5× by default, 3× when success rate < 50%).
  - **SuccessTracker** — per-tool success/failure ratios. Queried on every `SuggestDelay()` call to adjust timeouts.
  - **SequencePredictor** — TF-IDF-style word index from `training_pairs`. Given OCR text, tokenizes and scores each word→command mapping by historical success frequency. Returns ranked predictions with confidence (0.0–1.0) and sample size.

- **MCP Resources (5)** — auto-exposed to the AI client, read on every session context:
  - `datalog://stats` — current row counts for all four datalog tables
  - `datalog://commands` — 20 most recent command log entries
  - `datalog://ocr` — 10 most recent OCR snapshots
  - `datalog://pairs` — 20 most recent training pairs
  - `adaptive://analysis` — full adaptive engine analysis (timing stats, success rates, learned sequences)

- **Agent MCP Tools (3)** — AI-queryable loop for context-aware decisions:
  - `agent_analyze` — returns full timing stats, success rates, and top learned sequences for AI decision-making
  - `agent_suggest` — given OCR screen text, predicts the best next command ranked by confidence
  - `agent_train` — rebuilds the word→command index from current `training_pairs` table

- **Auto training pair generation** — passive OCR bridge creates triple (ocr_before, command, ocr_after) without slowing commands:
  - Ring buffer of last 5 OCR snapshots with timestamps
  - Every command auto-pairs with most recent OCR (within 3s window) as `ocr_before`
  - Next OCR snapshot completes as `ocr_after`
  - Command stored as `{"tool":"name","args":"..."}` JSON for robust parsing

### Fixed

- **`datalog_query` table name mismatch** — switch-case expected short names (`"commands"`, `"ocr"`, `"chains"`, `"pairs"`) but the handler passed raw table names. Now accepts both forms as aliases.
- **`TrainFromDatalog` JSON parsing** — robust `extractToolFromJSON` helper handles both JSON `{"tool":"..."}` and plain string command values.

### Changed

- **Tool count** — 111 → 114
- **VERSION** — bumped 0.2.15 → 0.2.16
- **gen-tools-doc.go** — added "Adaptive Agent" category
- **LogCommand** — now releases SQLite lock before OCR bridge to avoid deadlock with LogOCRSnapshot (no cross-lock ordering)
- **LogTrainingPair** — `Command` field stores structured `{"tool":"name","args":"..."}` JSON instead of raw args string

### Documentation

- **docs/tools.md** — regenerated with 114 tools across categories including "Adaptive Agent"

## [0.2.15] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Data logging database** (`internal/actions/datalog.go`) — new SQLite DB at `%APPDATA%/go-mcp-computer-use/datalog/datalog.db` with four tables:
  - `command_log` — every chain/tool execution with args, success, duration, error text
  - `chain_log` — full chain executions with step counts, success/fail breakdown, chain JSON
  - `ocr_log` — OCR snapshots with full OCR text, word count, linked screenshot image path
  - `training_pairs` — OCR-before + command + OCR-after triples for ML sequence learning

- **Automatic logging hooks** — chains, individual commands, and OCR calls are logged automatically via goroutines with no performance impact on the main execution path.

- **Three new MCP tools:**
  - `datalog_query` — query any table (commands, chains, ocr, pairs) with filters (source, tool, success), returns rows as JSON
  - `datalog_export` — export training pairs as JSON array for downstream ML training pipelines
  - `datalog_status` — get row counts for all four tables

### Changed

- **VERSION** — bumped 0.2.14 → 0.2.15
- **Tool count** — 108 → 111

## [0.2.14] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **`NormalizedElement` coordinate system** — element positions stored as window-relative 0.0–1.0 fractions via `WindowNormalizer` in `internal/actions/dpi.go`. Layout-independent across screen resolutions and multi-monitor. Includes `GetDPIScaleForWindow`, `Normalize`/`Denormalize` helpers, and `ProportionalRegion` for computing screen-absolute OCR crops as a percentage of the active window.

- **`OCRProportionalWindowRegion`** — new OCR function in `ocr.go` that takes a window handle + proportional fractions, eliminating hardcoded pixel crops.

- **Auto-expand tiny OCR regions** — `FindTextAndClick` now detects crops <300px in any dimension and falls back to a generous 5%–95% of the active window. Prevents "Desktop not found" failures on small fixed-pixel regions.

- **Window context in ONNX detection** — `DetectionOutput` carries `WindowTitle` and `Normalized []NormalizedElement` alongside absolute coordinates. Computed per-active-window during inference.

- **Training schema migration** — `training_samples` table gains `window_rect TEXT` and `normalized_coords TEXT` columns. `saveTrainingSampleDirect` accepts and persists both normalized coords and window rect JSON.

### Fixed

- **`NormalizeElement` missing Class/Confidence copy** — `WindowNormalizer.NormalizeElement` returned a `NormalizedElement` with zeroed `Class` and `Confidence` fields. Exposed by round-trip test (`TestNormalizeElementRoundTrip`). Now copies both fields before returning.

### Changed

- **Watcher cache** — `CachedDetection` includes `Normalized` elements alongside absolute `Elements`. Training samples from watcher snaps now carry window rect context.
- **VERSION** — bumped 0.2.13 → 0.2.14

### Tests

- **Coordinate system tests** — `dpi_test.go` with 6 tests covering: normalize/denormalize round-trip, coordinate bounds (corners, center, size), proportional region math, `NormalizeElement` class/confidence round-trip, and zero-size window edge case.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- **ONNX detection timeout (65s → 599ms)** — root cause was not DLL incompatibility but performance:
  - `parseYOLOOutput` passed all 8400 raw detections through NMS at O(n²) = ~15M iterations
  - `MemoryStoreDetectionElements` called `MemorySet` 5507 times — each a separate SQLite INSERT with global mutex lock
  - Fixed: `parseYOLOOutput` now applies confidence threshold early (0.25), pre-filtering to ~50 boxes before NMS
  - Fixed: `MemoryStoreDetectionElements` rewritten with batched SQLite inserts in a single transaction, capped at 200 elements

### Changed

- **ONNX Runtime DLL updated** — v1.20.1 → v1.26.0 to support opset 22 (required by yolo11n.onnx). Limited opset support warning is non-fatal.

## [0.2.12] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- **Release binaries crash with STATUS_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION** — Zig cc on GHA runners defaults to `-march=native`, generating CPU-specific instructions incompatible with older machines (Pentium Gold G5400). Pinned `-mcpu=x86_64_v2` in `CGO_CFLAGS` so binaries run on any x86-64 CPU.
- **CGO_LDFLAGS also needs `-mcpu=x86_64_v2`** — `actions/setup-go@v5` overrides `CGO_LDFLAGS` with `-O2 -g`, dropping the CPU baseline. Both `CGO_CFLAGS` (compile) and `CGO_LDFLAGS` (link) now pin `-mcpu=x86_64_v2`.

### Changed

- **`scripts/build.ps1`** — added `CGO_CFLAGS` with `-mcpu=x86_64_v2` baseline for portable builds
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** — same CPU baseline pin in both `CGO_CFLAGS` and `CGO_LDFLAGS`, plus `-fno-sanitize=all` and `-Wno-error`

## [0.2.11] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **`scripts/gen-tools-doc.go`** — parses `internal/server/server.go` for `mcp.AddTool` calls, generates `docs/tools.md` with categorized 108-tool listing. CI validates freshness on every push/PR.
- **`scripts/push-and-release.ps1`** — one-shot auto-release: reads VERSION, commits with changelog body, tags, pushes, waits for release workflow, downloads binary, replaces `mcp-server.exe`, restarts OpenCode Desktop as admin.
- **`docs/tools.md`** — auto-generated tool reference doc (never stale).
- **`docs/security.md`**, **`docs/configuration.md`**, **`docs/build.md`**, **`docs/architecture.md`**, **`docs/accessibility.md`** — split from monolithic README.
- **Weekly module maintenance** — `.github/workflows/mod-maintenance.yml` runs `go get -u ./...` + auto-PR every Monday.
- **CI: `go mod tidy` validation** — fails if `go.mod`/`go.sum` drifts from tidy state.

### Changed

- **README.md** — collapsed 383→92 lines, links to focused docs/ split.
- **Root docs moved** — `plan.md`, `todo.md`, `backlog.md`, `known-issues.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` relocated to `docs/`.
- **CGO mandatory** — removed all `-NoCGO` flags, pure-Go fallback paths, and optional-CGO language across 9 files. `release.yml` now produces a single `mcp-server.exe` (CGO+Zig).
- **Release workflow** — single binary output, no `-cgo` suffix variant.
- **`scripts/build.ps1`** — removed `-NoCGO` switch, always requires Zig cc.

### Documentation

- **README split** — large sections moved into focused docs for maintainability.
- **All NoCGO references removed** — across `plan.md`, `adr-002`, `comparison-vs-windows-recall.md`, `ci-cd-pipeline.md`, `build.md`, `README.md`.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-06-29

### Documentation

- **Systematic doc audit** — fixed 90 stale statements across 12 docs: tool counts (103→108 restored from actual registrations), version refs, CGO/dependency claims, category counts, missing tool listings, completed Slice 4 checkboxes, stale future-tool lists
- **Architecture guide** — added Part 6 to computer-use-guide: layered agent stack (LLM→MCP→Controller→Perception→Memory→World), ML vision + spatial memory, division of responsibilities, convergence of LLM+MCP+ML
- **Source fix** — server.go tool count hardcode corrected 103→108 to match actual registrations
- **Config auto-start** — watcher_auto_start config created on dev machine

### Changed

- **VERSION** — bumped 0.2.9 → 0.2.10

## [0.2.9] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **`scripts/build.ps1`** — unified build script with `-UseZig` flag for CGO-enabled builds
- **CI/CD: CGO + Zig cc build pipeline** — CI now runs two jobs: no-CGO lint+build and CGO+Zig build. Release workflow produces both `mcp-server.exe` (no CGO) and `mcp-server-cgo.exe` (with ONNX support).
- **Zig 0.16.0 support** — `scripts/install.ps1` updated to download Zig 0.16.0

### Documentation

- **README.md** — documented CGO requirements for ONNX tools with Zig cc build instructions
- **known-issues.md** — B13: ONNX tools require CGO (documented workaround)
- **Tool count docs updated** — all docs updated to 108 tools, stale CGO claims corrected

## [0.2.8] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **`key_down` / `key_up` MCP tools** — separate key hold/release for game-play sequences. Chains can now hold movement keys while dragging camera and pressing abilities, all server-side with no round-trip latency. `KeyDown("W")` holds the key, `KeyUp("W")` releases. Full VK support including modifiers, letters, digits, and special keys.

- **`keylogger_start` / `keylogger_stop` / `keylogger_status` MCP tools** — record real keyboard + mouse input (keys, clicks, drags, moves, scroll) via low-level Windows hooks (`WH_KEYBOARD_LL` + `WH_MOUSE_LL`). Output is a chain-compatible JSON sequence for AI replay. Includes timing-accurate delays between events. Mouse clicks auto-detect drag vs click by distance/time thresholds. Mouse moves throttled to meaningful position changes.

- **`sendVKPress` helper with 50ms inter-key delay** — `KeyPress`, `TypeText`, `sendCharWithVK` now use `sendVKPress(vk)` which inserts a 50ms `time.Sleep` between key down and key up. Fixes game engines and DirectInput applications that miss instant down/up sequences (character switch hotkeys 1-4, ability keys).

### Fixed

- **`warnElevated` false positive when both server and target are elevated** — `warnElevated()` only checked if the foreground window was elevated, not the MCP server itself. If both are elevated (server running as Admin targeting an admin game), `SendInput` keyboard works fine, but the check falsely blocked it. Added `isSelfElevated()` — only blocks keyboard when server is non-elevated AND target is elevated.

- **`KeyPress` modifier ordering** — `["CTRL", "C"]` sent `C` via Unicode first, then pressed Ctrl down, then released Ctrl. The key arrived before the modifier was held. Rewrote to process keys in order: modifiers are pressed immediately, target keys are sent while held, all modifiers released in reverse at end.

- **Keyboard input uses VK codes instead of `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE`** — `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` synthesizes `WM_CHAR` messages, which many applications ignore (game engines, terminals, code editors, browser input fields). Rewrote all keyboard functions to use VK codes:
  - `TypeText` and `TypeAndSubmit` use `sendCharWithVK()` — maps each character to its VK code + Shift state using `charToVK` table (US keyboard layout). Letters, digits, punctuation all handled.
  - `KeyPress` sends all keys (letters, digits, special keys) as VK codes. Modifier combos like Ctrl+C now work correctly: Ctrl down → VK_C → Ctrl up.

- **`Drag` incremental movement** — was sending a single jump from start to end (mouseDown → teleport → mouseUp). Games and map UIs ignored this as a teleport. Now sends 5–50 incremental steps with 5ms delays, proportional to distance. Map panning now works correctly.

### Changed

- **`sendUnicode` removed** — no longer used. All keyboard input via VK codes.
- **Tool count**: 103 → 108 (added `key_down`, `key_up`, `keylogger_start`, `keylogger_stop`, `keylogger_status`).

### Documentation

- **Elevation & UIPI** section in README — explains admin vs non-admin behavior
- **Known issues B11, B12** — documented keyboard issues and fixes

## [0.2.7] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Statistical prior model** (`priors_stats` tool) — Go-native "training" without Python. Element frequency + position distributions are learned per window from collected training samples. Priors boost confidence for expected elements (e.g., "laptop" in browser windows) and suppress unlikely ones (e.g., "tv" in code editor). Position outliers beyond 3σ are penalized.
- **Prior-based confidence adjustment** — `ONNXDetect` now calls `AdjustConfidenceWithPriors()` after NMS, adjusting every detection's confidence based on learned per-window statistics. Gated by `prior_adjustment` config field (default: `true`).
- **`export_yolo_dataset` tool** — exports unused training samples (signal_level >= 1) as a YOLO-format dataset (images + normalized label files + train/val split + `dataset.yaml`). Users with Python can train externally via Ultralytics.
- **`training_cleanup_noise` tool** — deletes low-signal (signal_level=0) samples older than a threshold. Supports `dry_run=true` to preview deletions. Frees disk space from watcher noise frames.
- **`training_enabled` config field** — when set to `false`, disables all auto-save training snapshots (both from actions and the background watcher). Default: `true`.
- **`prior_adjustment` config field** — when set to `false`, disables prior-based confidence adjustment in ONNXDetect. Default: `true`.
- **Priors auto-populated on save** — every training sample save (raw or watcher) also updates element priors via `UpdatePriorsFromDetections`. Negative samples (zero elements) update frequency denominators.

### Changed

- **`set_config` tool** — runtime config changes without restart. Accepts: `training_enabled` (stop/start background data collection), `prior_adjustment`, `verify_bounds`, `log_level`, `watcher_enabled` (start/stop watcher), `watcher_interval_seconds` (change polling frequency live). Changes persist to disk immediately. Enables users to disable data collection and control the watcher mid-session for privacy or debugging.
- **`watcher_auto_start` / `watcher_interval_seconds` config** — `watcher_auto_start: true` starts the background watcher on server boot with the configured interval. Default: `false`.
- **Tool count**: 99 → 103 (added `priors_stats`, `export_yolo_dataset`, `training_cleanup_noise`, `set_config`).

### Fixed

- **`SendInput` silently dropping mouse clicks** — the `input` struct in `mouse.go` had an orphan `_ [8]byte` padding field, making `unsafe.Sizeof` = 48 bytes. Windows `sizeof(INPUT)` on x64 is 40 bytes. `SendInput` returns 0 when `cbSize` doesn't match, so `SetCursorPos` moved the cursor but the click event never fired. Removed the extra padding — struct is now exactly 40 bytes.
- **Network struct layout mismatches** — `IP_ADDR_STRING` was missing `_ [4]byte` trailing padding (44→48 bytes). `IP_ADAPTER_INFO` and `FIXED_INFO` used `[260/132]uint16` for `char` arrays (2x Windows size, shifting every subsequent field). Changed to `[260/132]byte` and added alignment padding after `DhcpEnabled`.
- **All Windows API structs verified** — audited every struct passed to Win32 via `unsafe.Pointer` in `internal/actions/`: `mouseInput` (32B ✓), `input` (40B ✓), `point` (8B ✓), `keyboardInput` (24B ✓), `inputKbd` (40B ✓), `BITMAPINFOHEADER` (40B ✓), `RECT`, `MONITORINFOEXW`, `DEVMODEW`, `MEMORYSTATUSEX`, `SYSTEM_POWER_STATUS`, `PROCESSENTRY32W`, `LASTINPUTINFO`, `VARIANT`, `UiaRect`, `WinRect` — all match Windows x64 sizes.

### Changed

- **`Drag` rewritten for raw input games** — replaced `SetCursorPos` (invisible to DirectInput/raw input) with `SendInput` + `MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE | MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE`. Coordinates normalized to 0–65535 range. Game engines using raw input now see the movement between mouse-down and mouse-up.

### Documentation

- **Elevation & UIPI section** added to README — explains admin vs non-admin behavior (keyboard warns, mouse silently fails), how to run elevated, and reassurance that normal apps work fine without elevation.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Training data pipeline** (`training_save_sample`, `training_list_samples`, `training_stats`, `training_mark_used`) — persistent screenshot + ONNX detection storage for model fine-tuning. Images saved to categorized folders (`raw/click/`, `raw/type/`, `raw/navigate/`, `raw/ocr/`, `raw/general/`, `watcher/elements_found/`, `watcher/no_elements/`) with metadata in `samples.db`. Each sample carries a `task_prompt` string that the ML learns to predict during training.
- **Auto-save on every UI action** — `click`, `type`, `scroll`, `drag`, `hover`, `key_press`, `type_and_submit`, `select_all_and_type`, `browser_navigate`, `browser_search`, `open_url`, and `find_text_and_click` handlers (both direct MCP and chain steps) automatically capture a screenshot + ONNX detection + save to `raw/{category}/` with the action description as `task_prompt`.
- **`find_ui_element` tool** — three-layer cascading element locator: checks memory first (cached ONNX detections by window+label), runs ONNX detection with label matching, falls back to OCR for text elements. Stores findings in memory for reuse. Saves training samples (positive + negative).
- **Memory-backed element caching** — every `ONNXDetect` call auto-stores detected elements as memory facts (`memory_set`, scope `ui`, keyed `ui:{window_title}:{class}`) with 1-hour TTL. AI can query memory for known element locations without re-running ML.
- **Quality/signal filtering** — every training sample gets a `signal_level` (0=noise, 1=elements found, 2=elements+task context). `training_list_samples` accepts `min_signal` filter. Noise samples (watcher frames with zero elements) are flagged for discard.

### Changed

- **Restructured training directories** — from flat `samples/{cat}_{ts}.png` to `raw/{cat}/{ts}.png` + `watcher/{cat}/{ts}.png` layout. Database renamed from `training.db` to `samples.db`.
- **Watcher save path** — frames now save to `watcher/elements_found/` or `watcher/no_elements/` instead of flat `references/` dir.
- **ONNXDetect no longer auto-saves** — removal of inline `saveTrainingSampleDirect` in ONNXDetect to avoid caller confusion. Watcher handles persistence; explicit calls handle the rest.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- **`memory_set` schema validation** — `MemorySetArgs.Value any` generated `"value": true` in JSON Schema, which OpenCode's MCP validator rejected. Fixed with explicit `InputSchema` using `json.RawMessage` + description-only schema.
- **`close_window` Win32 API** — was calling `ShowWindowAsync(hwnd, 0x10)` but `0x10 = WM_CLOSE` is not a `ShowWindow` command. Changed to `PostMessageW(hwnd, WM_CLOSE, 0, 0)`.
- **`onnx_status` global state bug** — used global `modelsDir` which was empty when `InitONNX` failed. Now calls `getModelsDir()` directly.

### Added

- **Background watcher** (`onnx_watch_start/stop/status/cache`) — goroutine that periodically captures screen, runs ONNX detection, caches last 20 results, and auto-saves reference PNGs when detection returns zero elements.
- **`savePNG` auto-save in detection** — `onnx_detect` now saves a `ref_<ts>.png` to `%APPDATA%/go-mcp-computer-use/models/references/` when detection returns zero elements (AI confusion signal).
- **`focus_window_by_title`** — finds window by title, focuses, and clicks title bar to ensure activation.
- **Browser automation** — `browser_focus_url_bar`, `browser_new_tab`, `browser_navigate`, `browser_search`.
- **File Explorer automation** — `explorer_focus`, `explorer_open_path`.
- **`uia_warmup` config field** and async UIA warmup on startup.

### Changed

- **Eliminated Python dependency entirely** — removed `convertYoloToONNX()`, `detectWithPython()`, `pythonDetectResult` struct, `os/exec`, `bytes`, `strings` imports.
- **Switched YOLO model** — from HuggingFace `best.pt` (PyTorch, 57 MB, 7 UI classes) to Ultralytics pre-exported `yolo11n.onnx` (10.9 MB, 80 COCO classes).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-27

### Changed

- **v0.2.x branch baseline** — cut from v0.1.11 as starting point for v0.2 development. All subsequent changes on this branch increment as `+0.0.1` (v0.2.1, v0.2.2, etc.).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- **`chain` tool** — sequential step executor that runs multiple tools server-side without round trips. Supports `tool` (call any registered tool), `wait` (sleep N ms), and `capture` (save step output as `{{variable}}` for use in subsequent steps). Error modes: `stop` (halt on first error, default) or `skip`. Global timeout. 40+ tools dispatched.
- **Variable substitution** — `{{variable_name}}` in string args is replaced with captured output from earlier steps.
- **ChainFromJSON** — convenience entry point for programmatic chain execution from JSON string.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **`memory_set` / `memory_get` / `memory_search` / `memory_list` / `memory_forget` tools** — SQLite-backed memory store using `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, zero CGO). Database at `%APPDATA%/go-mcp-computer-use/memory.db` with WAL mode, FTS5 full-text search, auto-syncing triggers, TTL support, scope isolation, and tag filtering.
- **`layout_validate` tool** — validates stored UI element layouts against the current screen. Checks window existence, position drift (with tolerance), and OCR keyword verification around element coordinates. Returns per-element confidence (`ok`/`drifted`/`stale`) with adjusted coordinates.
- **`template_store` / `template_find` / `template_list` / `template_forget` tools** — self-growing template library. `template_store` auto-crops a 48×48 PNG template around a coordinate from the current screen and stores it in the `element_templates` table. `template_find` uses NCC template matching (`find_image`) to relocate the element visually on the current screen, returning coordinates and drift. Hit count auto-increments on each successful find, enabling the system to self-train over time.
- **`onnx_status` / `onnx_detect` / `onnx_download` tools** — ONNX ML backend for UI element detection. `onnx_status` checks runtime and model availability. `onnx_detect` runs YOLO11s inference on a screenshot or full screen to detect UI elements (button, textbox, checkbox, dropdown, icon, tab, menu_item) with bounding boxes and confidence scores. Uses `github.com/yalue/onnxruntime_go` for native ONNX Runtime support. Requires manual download of `onnxruntime.dll` and model files. Falls back gracefully when runtime/models are missing.
- **`focus_window_by_title` tool** — focus management for reliable keyboard input. Finds a window by title, focuses it, and clicks its title bar to ensure activation.
- **`ChainStep.FocusWindow` field** — chain steps can specify `focus_window: "window title"` to auto-focus and activate the window before executing the step. The chain executor handles window lookup, focus, title bar click, then runs the step.
- **`browser_focus_url_bar` / `browser_new_tab` / `browser_navigate` / `browser_search` tools** — generic browser automation (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera). `browser_focus_url_bar` focuses the URL bar (Ctrl+T for Firefox, Ctrl+L for others). `browser_new_tab` opens a new tab (Ctrl+T). `browser_navigate` opens a new tab and navigates to a URL. `browser_search` opens a new tab and performs a search query. Backed by `BrowserFocusURLBar`, `BrowserNewTab`, `BrowserNavigate`, `BrowserSearch` in `internal/actions/browseruse.go` — reusable composite functions that import existing modules instead of duplicating logic.
- **`explorer_focus` / `explorer_open_path` tools** — File Explorer automation. `explorer_focus` finds and activates an existing File Explorer window by title. `explorer_open_path` opens explorer at a given path, reusing existing windows when possible (Ctrl+L + path) or launching a new one. Backed by `ExplorerFocus`, `ExplorerOpenPath`, `ExplorerNavigateTo` in `internal/actions/windowexploreruse.go`.

### Changed

- **Replaced `firefox_focus_url_bar`** — removed Firefox-specific function from `chained.go`. Replaced with generic `browseruse.go` that detects browser type from window title and uses browser-specific keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+T for Firefox URL bar, Ctrl+L for Chrome/Edge).
- **Refactored `FocusWindowByTitle`** — now delegates to shared `focusAndActivateWindow` helper, reducing duplication across browser, explorer, and generic focus code paths.

### Removed

- **`FirefoxFocusURLBar`** — removed from `internal/actions/chained.go`. Superseded by `BrowserFocusURLBar`. Tool name changed from `firefox_focus_url_bar` to `browser_focus_url_bar`.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- **`TypeAndSubmit` Enter via `KeyPress`** — appended `\r` used `sendUnicode(0x0D)` which sends the CR character via `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE`, unreliable in Firefox/browser address bars. Replaced with `KeyPress([]string{"ENTER"})` with a 50ms pause, matching the same code path used by the `key_press` handler.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **`poll` step type** — polls OCR at `every_ms` interval until `ocr_contains` text is found or `timeout_ms` elapses. Syntax: `{"poll": {"every_ms": 1000, "timeout_ms": 30000, "ocr_contains": "Submit"}}`.
- **`if` step type** — OCR checks for `ocr_contains` text, executes `then` or `else` branch. Syntax: `{"if": {"ocr_contains": "Error", "then": [...], "else": [...]}}`.
- **`loop` step type** — repeats sub-steps `times` iterations. Syntax: `{"loop": {"times": 5, "steps": [...]}}`.
- **`StepResult.Steps`** — nested step results for if/loop sub-steps, visible in chain output.
- **UIA warmup at server startup** — pre-initializes COM and creates/releases a UIA instance, absorbing the one-time 15-42s cold-start cost so handlers respond instantly.
- **`WarmupUIA()`** — exported function to pre-warm COM/UIA at server startup.

### Fixed

- **StepResult.Index always `0`** — `execWait`/`execTool` created fresh `StepResult` structs discarding the loop index. Index is now set after the switch.
- **`SelectAllAndType` uses VK codes** — `sendUnicode(0x01)` used `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` (VK_PACKET) which doesn't trigger select-all in most apps. Replaced with `sendVK(VK_CONTROL)` + `sendVK(VK_A)` for reliable Ctrl+A.
- **Variable substitution supports dotted paths** — regex `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+` didn't match `{{size.width}}`. Updated to `[a-zA-Z0-9_.]+` with `resolveVarPath()` for nested map lookups.
- **`SelectAllAndType` elevated warning** — now calls `warnElevated()` before sending input, preventing silent drops on admin windows.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- **VERSION file + ldflags** — single source of truth at project root, injected via `-X main.Version`, replaces hardcoded string
- **CI/CD pipeline** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (build + vet on push/PR), `.github/workflows/release.yml` (tag-triggered GitHub Release with binary + SHA256 + changelog)
- **`.govetallow`** — documents COM/WinRT unsafe.Pointer conventions for vet policy
- **`scripts/lint.ps1`** — local CI runner: vet + build + tests

### Changed

- **COM types** — all interface pointers stored as `unsafe.Pointer` instead of `uintptr`:
  `uiaAuto.p`, `uiaCondition.p`, `uiaElement.p`, `uiaElementArray.p`,
  `bstrToGo` parameter, `getCurrentPattern` return type
- **`vtblMethod`** — rewritten with `unsafe.Pointer` parameter + `unsafe.Add`, satisfies vet's unsafeptr checker
- **Syscall output params** — all local variables receiving COM pointers via SyscallN declared as `unsafe.Pointer` instead of `uintptr`
- **GUID literals** — all 14 `windows.GUID` values in `winrt.go` use keyed fields
- **CI workflows** — use `scripts/lint.ps1` instead of raw `go vet`

## [0.1.10] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- Keyboard VK-coded keys (Enter, Backspace, Tab, Ctrl+letter) sent via `sendKey`/`KeyPress` were silently dropped by the system — only `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` path worked. Rewrote keyboard handling to send **all** keys through `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` where possible: special keys map to Unicode control characters (Enter=0x0D, Backspace=0x08, Ctrl+A-Z=0x01-0x1A). VK fallback only for non-printable keys (arrows, F-keys, Insert, etc.)
- `TypeAndSubmit` and `SelectAllAndType` now use Unicode path instead of VK-coded `KeyPress` for Enter and Ctrl+A

## [0.1.9] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- B9: UIPI elevation detection for keyboard input (`TypeText`, `KeyPress`) — returns clear warning when foreground window is elevated (admin), instead of silently dropping input

## [0.1.8] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- B3: `list_displays` only returned primary monitor — `monitorEnumProc` gated on `MONITORINFOF_PRIMARY` flag, skipping all non-primary displays

## [0.1.7] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- B4: `uia_get_text` / `uia_invoke` no longer crash MCP transport — `GetCurrentPattern` nil check added before pattern operations

## [0.1.6] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- B2: `list_audio_devices` returns `[]` instead of `null` — empty PowerShell output produced nil slice which serialized as JSON `null`

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- B6: `Wait()` calculation was **1 million times too long** — `NtDelayExecution` argument was `-(ns * 10000)` instead of `-(ms * 10000)`, causing `hover` (and any tool calling `Wait`) to block for hours instead of milliseconds

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- B1: `get_brightness` returns clear "brightness not supported on this display" instead of parse error when display doesn't support WMI brightness control (desktop monitors)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- B5: `screenshot_element` now clamps off-screen window coordinates to screen bounds instead of rejecting them (e.g., windows with `x=-8` from Aero Snap)
- Multi-monitor: `ScreenSize()` now returns virtual desktop dimensions (`SM_CXVIRTUALSCREEN`/`SM_CYVIRTUALSCREEN`) instead of primary monitor only, fixing coordinate validation across multiple displays

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- UIA COM and OCR WinRT apartment model conflict: changed `RoInitialize` from `RO_INIT_SINGLETHREADED` to `RO_INIT_MULTITHREADED` so both UIA and OCR use MTA on the same thread, preventing `RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE` error

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- **Native WinRT COM OCR** — replaces PowerShell OCR with direct COM calls: `StorageFile.GetFileFromPathAsync` → `OpenAsync` → `BitmapDecoder.CreateAsync` → `GetSoftwareBitmapAsync` → `OcrEngine.RecognizeAsync`. Zero CGO, no Windows SDK needed.
- **Native COM UI Automation** — replaced PowerShell UIA with direct COM calls to `UIAutomationCore.dll` (IUIAutomation, IUIAutomationElement, conditions, patterns). All operations via native COM.
- **WinRT COM infrastructure** (`winrt.go`) — HSTRING management, `RoInitialize`, `RoGetActivationFactory`, `IAsyncInfo` polling, COM helpers
- OCR falls back to PowerShell if native COM fails

### Changed

- All OCR and UIA operations now use native COM instead of PowerShell — **2-8x faster**
  - OCR full screen: 653→292ms (2.2x)
  - OCR region 400×400: 542→68ms (8x)
  - find_text_and_click: 809→275ms (2.9x)
- `comRelease` signature changed from `uintptr` to `unsafe.Pointer` for unified COM cleanup
- ADR-002 updated: project now uses native COM/WinRT, not just Win32 API

### Fixed

- WindowsGetStringRawBuffer signature: actual DLL export returns buffer pointer in RAX (2 params), not as out parameter (3 params) — MSDN docs differ from Win10 10.0.26100 behavior
- All vtable reads: corrected `*(*[N]uintptr)(obj)` pattern (reads object data) to `vtblMethod()` (reads actual vtable entries)
- OCR PowerShell script: properly loads WinRT types via `WindowsRuntimeSystemExtensions.GetAwaiter` with `MakeGenericMethod`, fixing OCR on systems where WinRT async extension methods don't resolve in PowerShell 5.1
- Go raw string literal: avoids backtick in `IAsyncOperation`1` by using `-like` wildcard matching
